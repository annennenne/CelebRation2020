On February 28 from 13.00-17.00, we offer two parallel, exiting workshops, **Contemporary ggplot2** hosted by Thomas Lin Pedersen and **Seamless R and C++ Integration with Rcpp** hosted by Dirk Eddelbuettel, described in more detail below. Note that there are limited seats available for each workshop and that tickets can be purchased when <a href="registration.html">registering for the conference</a>.


### Contemporary ggplot2

Workshop host: Thomas Lin Pedersen, software engineer at RStudio. 

#### Background
Data visualisation lies in the centre of how most data is inspected and communicated, whether that communication is between yourself and the computer, or between you and an audience. Visualisations shape how you think about data, and can thus also constrain your thinking if your ability to visualise data is limited. Because of this link between cognition and perception, it is important to be skilled in a visualisation framework that provides high flexibility and low cost of iteration. ggplot2 has been a successful framework for both explorative and publication-ready data visualisation for more than 10 years, and is still being actively developed and expanded. It’s success is to a high degree due to the flexible theoretical foundation of the API, that allows you to quickly iterate and change between different plot types without having to change mindset.

#### Learning outcome
This workshop will teach you the fundamental parts of ggplot2, with a focus on understanding the “why”. This means that you will not just learn “how to make a bar plot with ggplot2”, but “how to make any plot with ggplot2”. The workshop will be a mix of theory and practical exercises so that the API will be both understood and internalised. While the basics will be taught, there will be an emphasis on “modern” ggplot2, meaning that recent and upcoming features will take up a fair chunk of the time, as will the flourishing ecosystem of extension packages. It is thus the aim that attendants will become equipped to follow and explore the the ever-expanding world of ggplot2.

#### Prerequisites
It is assumed that attendants have basic experience in using R as R syntax, data import and data wrangling will not be taught. No prior knowledge or experience of ggplot2 is assumed. That being said, if you have used ggplot2 before, the focus on newer features and extensions will make sure that you will likely learn something new as well.

#### About the instructor
Thomas is part of the tidyverse team at RStudio, where he focuses on improving the performance of graphic rendering in R as well as taking part in maintaining ggplot2 and related packages. He is the developer of the `ggraph` and `gganimate` packages, among others and blogs about data visualization and data art at https://www.data-imaginist.com/. He has a background in computational biology.
