The R language is a free, robust, popular open source programming language and platform used in all areas of data analysis, statistics and visualization. Standing out as one of the most quickly growing programming languages in the world, it is used in a large array of companies and academic organizations in statistics, finance, business, biology, bioinformatics, humanities and all areas of science.

**The year 2020 marks the 20th anniversary of the release of R version 1.0.0!**

To celebrate this, we are gathering the huge community of R users and developers for a two-day celebRation 28-29th February 2020. We kick off on 28th February with hands-on tutorials on some of the currently hot topics among R users. The day of the anniversary – February 29 – presents a line-up of speakers who cover the past, the present, and the future of the R programming language. 


The conference will adhere to the R Foundation [Code of Conduct](codeofconduct.html).
